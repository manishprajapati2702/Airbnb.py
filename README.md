Airbnb is a global online marketplace connecting hosts offering accommodations and experiences with guests seeking unique stays worldwide.The platform has grown significantly,boasting over 8 million active listings across more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries,revenue,reaching $3.73 billion.

Story behind Airbnb 's formation
Airbnb started as a simple idea in 2007 when two roommates,Neel Rana and Yash Rana.A big design conference was happening in the city and hotels were fully booked.Seeing an opportunity,they decided to rent out air mattresses in their living room and provide breakfast for guests.They called this small venture "Air Bed & Breakfast".

Suppose you are working the data-driven domain at Airbnb.You have a dataset and need to derive insights from it to answer key business question as company officials aim to grow the business.

This project, hosted in the repository manishprajapati2702/Airbnb.py, is focused on analyzing Airbnb listing data using Python, with a particular emphasis on data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook (Airbnb_data.ipynb), which makes it interactive and easy to follow.


Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of what the project does:

## 1. Data Import and Libraries
The notebook begins by importing key Python libraries for data analysis and visualization:

- numpy and pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

The dataset is read from a CSV file named Airbnb_data.csv.

## 2. Data Exploration
Initial exploration includes:

- Displaying the first few rows with df.head()
- Listing all column names
- Checking for missing values with df.isnull().sum() and df.info()

## 3. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Several steps are taken to handle missing or inconsistent data:

- The 'last review' column is converted to datetime format, with errors coerced to NaT (Not a Time).
- Missing values in 'reviews per month' are filled with 0, and missing dates in 'last review' are filled with the earliest date in that column.
- Rows with missing values in 'NAME' or 'host name' are dropped.
- Unnecessary columns like 'license' and 'house_rules' are removed if present.
- The 'price' and 'service fee' columns are cleaned by removing dollar signs and commas, then converted to float types for analysis.
- Duplicate rows are removed.

## 4. Data Visualization and Analysis
The notebook answers several business questions using visualizations:

 Q1. What is the distribution of listing prices?
- A histogram (with KDE) shows the spread of prices, indicating there is no strong concentration in any specific price range.

Q2. How are different room types distributed?
- A countplot visualizes the distribution of room types (e.g., entire home, private room).

 Q3. How are listings distributed across different neighborhoods?
- A countplot shows the number of listings in each neighborhood group.

Q4. What is the relationship between price and room type?
- A boxplot displays the price range for each room type, allowing comparison across categories.

Q5. How has the number of reviews changed over time?
- A line plot tracks the number of reviews per month, showing trends over time.

5. Descriptive Statistics
The notebook uses df.describe() to provide summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) for numerical columns.

Project Purpose and Use
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques using real-world Airbnb data. Such a workflow is typical in data science projects where the aim is to understand the data, identify patterns, and extract insights that could be valuable for business decisions or further modeling.
